\begin{section}{Nethack - Mason Fabel}
For the application domain study, I chose to study the classic roguelike
game Nethack. I chose this title for a number of reasons. First of all,
the roguelike genre is, if not the direct predecesor, the inspiration for
the majority of tile-based dungeon crawling games, among others. This being
so, I chose Nethack as it a mature and heavily played roguelike, being one
of a handful of big-name roguelike games.

For my study, I am going to play a session of Nethack and record a
condensed version of my adventures. I will then discuss the elements that
I think can be used successfully in our project, followed by the elements
that I think can not.
